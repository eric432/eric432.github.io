      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>I am a front end developer who landed in this vocation via a design path. I have been designing and building websites
        and applications since...well since we used
        <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> to hack together page structure. It's been an interesting journey so far.</p>

          <h2>Skills I bring to the table</h2>
          <p>Web development is a never ending learning process. I am a perpetual learner who's fine tuned my hunter gather skills
            in my quest to make things work as efficiently as possible...or on occasion, just get it working depending on the
            deadline and budget. The percentage bar displays my self evaluated progress of these various skills.</p>
