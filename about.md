About Me? Who would want to know?
Here is a link to my Portland music blog [ETHERBOMB](http://www.etherbomb.com/ "Portland Music Blog") where I (rarely these days) post my random tohughts on music. I have performed (mostly on bass) in numerous musical acts over the years in both Portland OR and Tucson AZ.

Some fun development project POCs I have saved.

* [Pretzel Animation](http://baldoni.net/pretzel/) Simple fun animtion using particles.js
* [Parallax and Waypoints](http://baldoni.net/parallax/) Scrolling animation demo with Waypoints
* [Contest Counter](http://baldoni.net/contest-counter/) Ajax/php conest counter to click button and update text file.
* [Wordpress Theme](http://wordpress.bitclone.com/) I have built many custom Wordpress themes over the years, here is a link to my base theme.
